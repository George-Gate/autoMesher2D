# autoMesher2D
A simple auto mesher for Simply Connected Polygon 2D Area

## About encoding
We have many chinese comments in this project, all the files should use UTF-8 encoding. If you want to run those scripts on Windows, it is recommended that you should change the encoding of those files to ANSI(GB-2312), otherwise you may see messy outputs.
